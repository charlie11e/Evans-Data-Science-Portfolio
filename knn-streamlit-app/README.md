## K-Nearest Neighbors Performance

This streamlit app analyzes the performance of the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier using the Titanic dataset. The user can select different numbers of neighbors (k) to see how it affects moddle performance, toggle between scaled and unscaled data to analyze the impact of feature scaling on classification, and view performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.
