# Basic Streamlit App
<h2> Hello, this is my first project of the semester, an app in streamlit. </h2>
<p>
This app uses the dataset Palmer's penguins. It observes 344 individual penguins and identifies their species and the island on which they live. It records their bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. The app I created in streamlit allows users to filter the dataset through the parameters previously stated. Users interact with selection boxes, sliders, check boxes, and buttons to filter the data. Formatted graphs and data frames allow the users to then analyze the data.
