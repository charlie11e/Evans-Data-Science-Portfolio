# Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio
<h2> Hello There! </h2>
Welcome to my portfolio for my class <b> Introduction to Data Science. </b> This contains all my projects for this semester.
<p></p>
<b> Here is what I have so far: </b>
 <p>
 1. In class exercises that showcase the learning tools I utilized to improve my skills
 <p>
 2. A basic streamlit app allowing for interactive analysis of a dataset on Palmer's penguins. 
<p>
3. A homework in which I practiced machine learning and linear regression.
<p>
4. A project in which I practiced tidying data and creating visualizations and aggregations from the cleaned data.
<p>
5. [A streamlit app that allows users to upload dataets and use regression and classification machine learning models to study the various properties of their datasets.](https://github.com/charlie11e/Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)
