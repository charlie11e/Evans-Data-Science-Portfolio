# Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio
Hello There!

Welcome to my portfolio for my class Introduction to Data Science. This contains all my projects for this semester.
Here is what I have so far:
 1. In class exercises that showcase the learning tools I utilized to improve my skills
 2. A basic streamlit app allowing for interactive analysis of a dataset on Palmer's penguins. 
3. A homework in which I practiced machine learning and linear regression.
4. A project in which I practiced tidying data and creating visualizations and aggregations from the cleaned data.
5. A machine learning streamlit app that allows users to upload their own datasets and use interactive regression and classification models with evaluation metrics.
6. An unsupervised machine learning streamlit app that allows users to upload their own datasets and use interactive PCA, KMeans, and Hierarchical models
