# Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio
Hello There!

Welcome to my portfolio for my class Introduction to Data Science. This contains all my projects for this semester.
Here is what I have so far:
 1. In [class exercises](https://github.com/charlie11e/Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/in-class-exercises) that showcase the learning tools I utilized to improve my skills
 2. A [basic streamlit app](https://github.com/charlie11e/Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app) allowing for interactive analysis of a dataset on Palmer's penguins. 
3. A [streamlit app](https://github.com/charlie11e/Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/knn-streamlit-app) that used a K Nearest Neighbor machine learning model to analyze the Titanic dataset.
4. A [project](https://github.com/charlie11e/Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) in which I practiced tidying data and creating visualizations and aggregations from the cleaned data.
5. A [machine learning streamlit app](https://github.com/charlie11e/Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) that allows users to upload their own datasets and use interactive regression and classification models with evaluation metrics.
6. An [unsupervised machine learning streamlit app](https://github.com/charlie11e/Evans-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp) that allows users to upload their own datasets and use interactive PCA, KMeans, and Hierarchical models
